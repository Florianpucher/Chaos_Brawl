# Chaos_Brawl
## Game Description
Chaos Brawl is a round / real-time strategy game for two to four players. Each player has a castle. The objective of this game is to use units and spells to destroy the main tower of the other players. Each unit and all spells cost mana, which regenerates over time. The player only has to place the units, command which opponents to attack them, and they will automatically attack that opponent. Spells can be cast via sensors from the smartphone. The opponent can block a spell or break its buff by also using the sensors from the smartphone.
